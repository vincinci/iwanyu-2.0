# Login Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The login page was showing "Request failed with status code 401" error due to:
1. **Response Interceptor Issue**: The Axios response interceptor was catching ALL 401 errors (including expected login failures) and redirecting to `/login`, causing infinite loops on the login page itself.
2. **Poor Error Handling**: Authentication errors weren't being handled properly to show meaningful messages to users.

## Root Cause
When users entered wrong credentials, the backend correctly returned a 401 status. However, the frontend interceptor treated this as "token expired" and redirected to login, preventing the actual error message from being displayed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Response Interceptor
- Added logic to detect if we're on authentication pages (`/login`, `/register`)
- Added logic to detect if the request is an authentication request (`/auth/*`)
- Only redirect to login for 401 errors if NOT on auth pages and NOT during auth requests
- This prevents infinite redirect loops

### 2. Improved Error Handling
- Enhanced login method to handle specific 401 authentication errors
- Enhanced register method to handle 401, 409 (conflict) errors  
- Better error messages for timeout scenarios
- Specific error extraction from backend responses

### 3. Better User Feedback
- Authentication errors now show proper messages like "Invalid email or password"
- Registration conflicts show "An account with this email already exists"
- Backend error messages are properly displayed to users

## Test Credentials
The admin account is working correctly:
- **Email**: `admin@iwanyu.store`
- **Password**: `admin123`

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Wrong credentials**: Shows proper error message (e.g., "Invalid email or password")
2. **Correct credentials**: Logs in successfully and redirects to dashboard
3. **Network issues**: Shows helpful timeout/connectivity messages
4. **No more 401 loops**: Login page works properly

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Fixes committed and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Frontend will auto-deploy to Vercel with fixes
- ✅ Backend is already working correctly
- ✅ No additional environment variables needed

The login page should now work properly without the 401 error loop!
