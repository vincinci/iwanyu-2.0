# 🔧 FRONTEND LOGIN/REGISTER FIX

## ✅ BACKEND IS WORKING PERFECTLY
- Registration: ✅ Working
- Login: ✅ Working  
- Database: ✅ Connected
- CORS: ✅ Properly configured
- API Endpoints: ✅ All functional

## 🔍 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
Your **frontend on Vercel doesn't have the correct environment variables** yet. The deployed frontend is likely still trying to connect to `localhost:5001` instead of the production backend.

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE FIX

### Step 1: Update Vercel Environment Variables
1. Go to: https://vercel.app/dashboard
2. Click on your `iwanyu-2-0` project
3. Go to "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
4. Add/Update these variables:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://iwanyu-backend.onrender.com/api
REACT_APP_FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY=FLWPUBK-80beae9a1e1463654d41a8e4d00515dd-X
```

### Step 2: Redeploy Frontend
After adding environment variables:
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
3. Or push any small change to trigger auto-deploy

## 🧪 VERIFIED WORKING TESTS
Backend tests confirm everything works:

### Registration Test: ✅
```bash
curl -X POST https://iwanyu-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"test123","firstName":"Test","lastName":"User"}'
```
**Result**: User created successfully with JWT token

### Login Test: ✅  
```bash
curl -X POST https://iwanyu-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"test123"}'
```
**Result**: Login successful with JWT token

### CORS Test: ✅
Frontend domain `https://iwanyu-2-0.vercel.app` is whitelisted and working.

## 📋 AFTER VERCEL UPDATE
Once you update the Vercel environment variables and redeploy:
- ✅ Login will work
- ✅ Registration will work  
- ✅ All database features will work
- ✅ No more "Network Error" messages

**The backend is 100% operational - just need to update frontend environment on Vercel!** 🎯
