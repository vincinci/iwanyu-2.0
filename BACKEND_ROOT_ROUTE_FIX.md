# Backend Root Route Fix

## Problem Fixed
Backend was throwing 500 errors when accessed at root path `/` because:
1. No route handler for `/` was defined
2. The `notFound` middleware was creating errors instead of returning 404 responses
3. Render's health checks and monitoring tools expect responses from `/`

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Root Route Handler
```typescript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    message: 'Iwanyu E-commerce API',
    version: '1.0.0',
    status: 'running',
    endpoints: { /* API endpoints list */ }
  });
});
```

### 2. Added Health Check Redirect
```typescript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.redirect('/api/health');
});
```

### 3. Fixed 404 Middleware
Changed from throwing errors to returning proper 404 JSON responses:
```typescript
export const notFound = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  res.status(404).json({
    success: false,
    error: 'Not Found',
    message: `The requested resource ${req.originalUrl} was not found`
  });
};
```

## Expected Results After Deployment
- ✅ `GET /` returns API information (200 status)
- ✅ `GET /health` redirects to `/api/health` (302 status)  
- ✅ Invalid routes return proper 404 JSON responses
- ✅ No more 500 errors in Render logs
- ✅ Render health checks will succeed

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- ⏳ Render will automatically redeploy
- ✅ Backend will stop throwing 500 errors on root path access

This fix resolves the "Not found - /" errors visible in Render deployment logs.
