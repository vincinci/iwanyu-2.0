## Summary of Changes

Your eCommerce application has been successfully cleaned and made **production-ready**! All mock/static data has been removed and the application now uses real API endpoints.

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. **Frontend Cleanup**
- **Orders Page**: Removed mock orders, now uses `apiService.getOrders()`
